## üìñ What I Learned

- **HTTP requests** ‚Üí developed an understanding of how to interact with external servers, applying it to implement a lightweight connectivity check for the application
- **JSON handling** ‚Üí learnt how to structure and work with JSON data, which I used to build a configuration file for storing user-defined settings such as tickers, threshold value, and email address
- **yfinance** ‚Üí became familiar with extracting live prices, historical data, and financial information through the yfinance library, making it the backbone of the project's data pipeline
- **Seaborn** ‚Üí explored Seaborn to enhance the quality of visualisations, producing cleaner and more professional-looking charts alongside matplotlib
- **Email automation** ‚Üí implemented functionality to send stock alerts directly to a user's inbox, gaining experience with programmatically creating and sending emails in Python
- **Task scheduling** ‚Üí learnt how to schedule the script to run automatically using Windows Task Scheduler, ensuring the program operates without manual intervention

## üìå Future Improvements

- **Push notifications** ‚Üí extend the alert system to support services like Pushover, Twilio SMS, or Slack bots, providing real-time notifications beyond email
- **Database integration** ‚Üí replace CSV/JSON storage with a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to improve scalability, reliability, and data management
- **Technical indicators** ‚Üí incorporate widely used financial indicators such as RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands to enable more advanced trading insights
